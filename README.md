This here's Andrew Nelson's and Ning Yan's ~~two-day project~~ novel invention worthy of a patent. It's an Arduino Uno board attached to an array of LEDs (see bottom left of photo) to get people excited. When they do, they make noise of course, and the microphone on the bow registers that as party time, signaling the DJ to start playing an awful rendition of Sandstorm on the 8-ohm speaker. Unfortunately, the DJ was inexperienced and couldn't get the potentiometer to work, so we had to leave that on shore. As it leaves harbor to Party Bay, the ~~servo~~ very powerful boat motor kicks up some swirly ~~paper~~ waves.
